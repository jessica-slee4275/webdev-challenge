Working space is "\htdocs"
Please click the "Generate with Default File". That is requirement in the webdev-challenge "https://github.com/nrigroup/webdev-challenge" There is Clean interface using bootstrap. Dynamic search according to what user write on search text box. This week was little bit tight to me for spare time for learning laravel, because I have worked full time until this week. If I could have more time, I would like to add regex for each data(date, category...) and store data monthly and yearly. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions via jessica.slee4275@gmail.com or 647-549-4275. Thank you.
